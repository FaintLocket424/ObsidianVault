If we have:
$$\sum_{n=0}^{10}f\left(n\right)$$

We can say that $j=n+7$ and replace $n$:
$$\sum_{j=7}^{17}f\left(j-7\right)$$
It helps to rearrange the equation to the format you need.

When replacing $n$, rearrange the equation to be $n=j-7$.
And when working out the new limits, just put the old ones into the equation and see what comes out.
$$j=(0)+7=7$$
$$j=(10)+7=17$$
