Suppose:
$$S(n)=1+2+3+...+n$$

If we write that backwards we get:
$$S(n)=n+(n-1)+(n-2)+...+1$$

If we sum those two together, we get:
$$2S(n)=(n+1)+(n+1)+(n+1)+...+(n+1)$$

Which is equal to:
$$S(n)=\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$$

So the sum of an arithmetic sequence that begins and $1$ and ends at $n$ is $S(n)$.
