Write this as partial fractions:
$$
\frac{x-1}{x^{2}(x^{2}+x+1)^{2}}
$$

$$
\frac{x-1}{x^{2}(x^{2}+x+1)^{2}} = \frac{A}{x} + \frac{B}{x^{2}} + \frac{Cx+D}{x^{2}+x+1} + \frac{Ex+F}{(x^{2}+x+1)^{2}}
$$
Then after multiplying out the denominators:
$$
\begin{align*}
x-1 &= Ax(x^{2}+x+1)^{2} + B(x^{2}+x+1) \\
&+ (Cx+D)x^{2}(x^{2}+x+1) + (Ex+F)x^{2}
\end{align*}
$$
Then we get 6 linear equations with 6 unknown.



LOOK AT LECTURE FOR 29/01/24 FOR THE REST.
i have actualy no idea what he's done. gonna have to rewatch the lecture for his explanation.
