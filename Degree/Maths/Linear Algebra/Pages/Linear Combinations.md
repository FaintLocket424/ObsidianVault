### Vector Combinations

Given some vectors $v_{1}, v_{2}, \ldots, v_{n}$ and some scalars $a_{1},a_{2},\ldots,a_{n}$

We can form a linear combination
$$
\sum^{n}_{i=1} a_{i}v_{i}= a_{1}v_{1} + a_{2}v_{2} + \dots + a_{n}v_{n}
$$
Just scaling some vectors then adding them together.

### Span

The set of all linear combinations from a set of vectors is called its span.

From a given set of vectors $\{\mathbf{v}_{1}, \mathbf{v}_{2}, \mathbf{v}_{3}, \ldots\}$, the span all the vectors you can make by scaling the vectors then adding them together.

If the field of the vector space is infinite then the span will be infinite as well.

### Spanning Set 

A set of vectors is a spanning set if its span is the whole vector space.

---
### Linear Dependence 

A set of vectors are linearly dependent if $\mathbf{0}$ is in the span without making any of the scalars zero.

In other words, you can write one of the vectors as a linear combination of the others.

If this is not possible, then the vectors are linearly independent.
