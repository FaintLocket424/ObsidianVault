### Radians

We define $\pi$ as the ratio between the circumference of a circle and it's diameter.
$$\pi=\frac{L}{2r}$$
Taking a circle and drawing an arc counter-clockwise of length $s$.

The angle $\theta$ within this arc is defined as: 
$$\theta=\frac{s}{r}$$
This is the definition of the radian. And if we go in a clockwise direction, we instead get:
$$\theta=-\frac{s}{r}$$
