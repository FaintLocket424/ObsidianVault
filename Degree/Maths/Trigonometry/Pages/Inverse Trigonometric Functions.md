### The $\arcsin$ function

$\sin{\left(\arcsin{x}\right)}=x$

$\arcsin{x}$ is literally just the inverse function of $\sin{x}$.

$\arcsin$ is defined for $-1\le x \le 1$ since $\sin{x}$ has a range of $-1\le \sin{x} \le 1$.

The range of $\arcsin$ is $-\frac{\pi}{2}\le\arcsin{x}\le\frac{\pi}{2}$ since that's the range in which the sine function does not repeat itself. In order for it to be an inverse function, it must map each input to only 1 output, hence the need to constrain it.

The function looks the same as if you just plotted $x=\sin{y}$. Because that is literally what it is.

### The $\arccos$ function

$\cos{\left(\arccos{x}\right)}=x$

$\arccos{x}$ is literally just the inverse function of $\cos{x}$.

$\arccos$ is defined for $-1\le x \le 1$ since $\cos{x}$ has a range of $-1\le \cos{x} \le 1$.

The range of $\arccos$ is $0\le\arccos{x}\le\pi$.

### The $\arctan$ function

$\tan{\left(\arctan{x}\right)}=x$

$\arctan{x}$ is literally just the inverse function of $\tan{x}$.

$\arctan$ is defined for $x\in\mathbb{R}$ as the $\tan$ function can output any real value.

The range of $\arctan$ is $-\frac{\pi}{2}<\arctan{x}<\frac{\pi}{2}$. Note that it's not defined for $\frac{\pi}{2}$ since that is undefined for $\tan{x}$.
