### The Square Root

The square root is what you get when you find the inverse function of $f(x)=x^2$.

The square root function is defined as:
$$(\sqrt{x})^2=x$$
And $\sqrt{x}\ge0$.

The domain of the square root function is the set of all $x$ with $x\ge0$.

![[IMAGE The square root function mirrored along y equals x.png]]
Here we can see $f(x)=x^2$ and $f(x)=\sqrt{x}$ plotted together on the graph.
And we can see it is a mirror image long $y=x$.

### The Quadratic Formula

The square root allows us to solve quadratics.
Wow. Crazy.

Take the standard quadratic $ax^2+bx+c=0$.

We can solve for the two values of $x$ using, you guessed it, the quadratic formulae.
$$
x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}
$$
#### The Discriminant
We can use the properties of $b^2-4ac$ within the quadratic formulae to determine how many roots the quadratic has.

If $b^2-4ac>0$, it has two distinct roots.
If $b^2-4ac=0$, it has one repeated root.
If $b^2-4ac<0$, it has no real roots.

### Completing the Square

We can also solve a quadratic and even derive the quadratic formula by completing the square.
$$x^2+bx+c=\left(x+\frac{b}{2}\right)^2-\left(\frac{b}{2}\right)^2+c$$
