![[Series MOC üåç]]

Individual contributions are called terms, denoted with a subscript $t_k$.

The collection of terms for all the subscript are called a sequence $\{a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},\dots\}$.

The sum of a sequence is called a series.

The sum of a series is its value.

A finite series contains a finite number of terms, like:
$$
\begin{align*}
\sum_{n=1}^{N} a_{n} &= a_{1} + a_{2} + a_{3} + a_{N}
\end{align*}
$$
An infinite series contains infinitely many terms:
$$
S = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a_{k} = a_{0} + a_{1} + a_{2} + \dots
$$
