Associativity of binary operations means that rearranging the parentheses does not affect the overall output.
$$
a \star (b \star c) = (a \star b) \star c
$$

Associative operations include addition and multiplication of integers.
$$
\begin{align*}
2 + (3 + 4) &= (2 + 3) + 4 = 9\\
\\
2 \times (3 \times 4) &= (2 \times 3) \times 4 = 24
\end{align*}
$$
