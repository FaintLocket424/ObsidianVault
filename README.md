My Obsidian Vault for whoever wishes to read it or use it for their own study.

Please Note, this is designed for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and does not work well with GitHub rendering. I recommend pulling the repo into Obsidian.

Also note, due to a bug with github's LaTeX renderer, any equations with two subscripts will not render correctly as github thinks it's an \__italics_\_ block instead of $x_{0}+ y_{0}$ like it should. There is nothing I can do about this as the fix would break the rendering for Obsidian, where this is supposed to be viewed from.
